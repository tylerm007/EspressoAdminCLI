# EspressoAdminCLI

## Description

This is a command-line tool to administer Espresso Logic servers. It allows the creation,
modification and deletion of many common objects, such as projects, database connection,
resources and rules.  Once you have your server running (cloud or on-premise) you will create one or more projects.  Each project can have one or more database connections which will create instant REST API endpponts for tables, views, and stored procedures.  Resources are used to create new custom endpoints (e.g. nested documents) and can be based on tables, JavaScript, MongoDB, or custom SQL.  Logic is applied as derivations on columns attributes, validations, and events on transactions.  Security and authentication is added to secure your REST endpoints.  

## Installation

    npm install espresso-admin-cli

Please note that, on Windows (and sometimes Mac), `npm install` will create an executable 
called `espressoadmin` in your
`<node_modules>/.bin` directory. If this directory is not in your `PATH`, you will probably
want to fix that, otherwise you'll have to specify the full path to the executable.  You can also try 
npm install -g espresso-admin-cli

***
## Login

    espressoadmin login <url> -u <user-name> -p <password> [-a <alias>]

### Parameters

The URL will normally be the address of the server, such as:

    https://eval.espressologic.com
    http://api.acme.com

If you specify an alias, then you will be able to refer to that connection using that alias.
This is useful if you plan to work with several servers at the same time.

Regardless, this command sets your *current server* -- see [the use command](/use/) below.

### Example
    $ espressoadmin login https://api.acme.com -u fred -p secret
    Logging in...
    This server licensed to: Acme Inc.
    Login successful, API key will expire on: 2014-11-27T03:36:55.266Z
